Overview
========

szl is a tiny, embeddable scripting engine inspired by Tcl and shell. It's a
balanced mix of Tcl and shell: szl combines the simplicity of shell scripting
with the power of Tcl and a rich standard library that includes bindings for
popular, permissively-licensed libraries.

Building
========

On Debian (http://www.debian.org) based distributions:

  $ apt-get install git gcc make pkg-config libz-dev libcurl-dev libarchive-dev
                    libssl-dev libffi-dev valgrind

Then:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dimkr/szl
  $ cd szl
  $ make
  $ make install

Under some CPU architectures (most notably, x86_64 and ARMv7), -fPIC is required
to produce shared libraries:

  $ make clean
  $ CFLAGS="-fPIC" make

By default, szl is built with core functionality built-in to the interpreter,
while a big part of the standard library resides in dynamically-loaded shared
objects. This way, the memory consumption of szl scripts that don't use the
entire standard library is lower.

However, in some use cases (for example, when szl is embedded into another
project), this is undesirable.

To build szl as a single executable file, with all extensions linked statically
into the interpreter:

  $ ALL_STATIC=1 make

In addition, built-in extensions can be chosen individually, e.g.:

  $ STATIC_CURL=1 STATIC_FFI=1 make

Running
=======

To run an interactive interpreter:

  $ szlsh

Or, to run a script:

  $ szlsh $path

Or, to run a one-liner:

  $ szlsh -c $snippet

Documentation
=============

To build the user manual:

  $ cd doc; make szl.html

To build the API documentation:

  $ cd doc; make api_docs
