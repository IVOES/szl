Overview
========

szl is a tiny, embeddable scripting engine inspired by Tcl and shell. It
combines the simplicity of shell scripting with the power of Tcl and a rich
standard library that includes bindings for popular, permissively-licensed
libraries.

Building
========

On Debian (http://www.debian.org) based distributions:

  $ apt-get install git gcc make pkg-config libz-dev libcurl-dev libarchive-dev
                    libssl-dev libffi-dev

Then:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dimkr/szl
  $ cd szl
  $ make
  $ make install

By default, szl is built with core functionality built-in to the interpreter,
while a big part of the standard library resides in dynamically-loaded shared
objects. This way, the memory consumption of szl scripts that don't use the
entire standard library is lower.

However, in some use cases (for example, when szl is embedded into another
project), this is undesirable.

To build szl with all extensions linked statically into the interpreter:

  $ ALL_STATIC=1 make

In addition, built-in extensions can be chosen individually, e.g:

  $ STATIC_CURL=1 STATIC_FFI=1 make

Running
=======

To run an interactive interpreter:

  $ szlsh

Or, to run a script:

  $ szlsh $path

Or, to run a one-liner:

  $ szlsh -c $snippet

Documentation
=============

To build the user manual:

  $ cd doc; make szl.html

To build the API documentation:

  $ cd doc; make api_docs
