Overview
========

szl is a tiny, embeddable scripting engine inspired by Tcl and shell. It's a
balanced mix of their key features: szl combines the simplicity of shell
scripting with the power of a dynamic, Tcl-like type system, minimalistic
syntax and programming language features missing in the shell, like exceptions
and OOP.

szl comes with a rich standard library that includes bindings for
permissively-licensed libraries. Therefore, it can run processes, parse text
with transparent Unicode support, manipulate data structures like dictionaries,
operate on binary data, interface with C code through scripts, multiplex
non-blocking I/O at scale, call REST APIs and much more, at a fraction of the
memory and size footprint of other scripting languages, while achieving
reasonable efficiency.

szl can be used both as a standalone (either interactive or non-interactive)
interpreter or as part of other projects, via the libszl library.

Building
========

On Debian (http://www.debian.org) based distributions:

  $ apt-get install git gcc meson zlib1g-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libarchive-dev
                    libssl-dev libffi-dev

Then:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dimkr/szl
  $ cd szl
  $ meson build
  $ cd build
  $ ninja
  $ ninja install

By default, szl is built with core functionality built-in to the interpreter,
while a big part of the standard library resides in dynamically-loaded shared
objects. This way, the memory consumption of szl scripts that don't use the
entire standard library is lower.

However, in some use cases (for example, when szl is embedded into another
project), this is undesirable.

To build szl as a single executable file, with all extensions linked statically
into the interpreter:

  $ mesonconf -Dbuiltin_all=true

In addition, built-in extensions can be chosen individually, e.g.:

  $ mesonconf -Dbuiltin_curl=true -Dbuiltin_ffi=true

Embedding
=========

To embed szl into other projects, use the API defined in szl.h and link with
libszl.

Running
=======

To run an interactive interpreter:

  $ szlsh

Or, to run a script:

  $ szl $path

Or, to run a one-liner:

  $ szl -c $snippet
